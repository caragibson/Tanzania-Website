                <h3>Sawala, Tanzania</h3>
                   <p>This past summer, I volunteered in Tanzania for 10 weeks with Raleigh International on an
                        International Citizen Service (ICS) placement. My project involved encouraging sustainable livelihoods and enterprise
                        development by working with groups and individuals in the rural community of Sawala. I built community
                        resilience through supporting young people and helping small businesses find ways to enhance the long
                        term sustainability of their enterprises.</p>

                <h3>My Volunteer Team: Echo 6</h3>
                <p>My volunteer team, Echo 6, was comprised of 15 young people from both the UK and Tanzania, including 2 team leaders. We spent every minute of the day working together and quickly built strong relationships with one another. I lived with a host family and fellow volunteer from Tanzania, Zuhura, who helped me communicate with the family and taught me basic Swahili phrases. I learnt about the Tanzanian lifestyle and culture from my homestay family, volunteers and community of Sawala.</p>

                <h3>Livelihoods Project</h3>
                <p>Our project involved encouraging sustainable livelihoods and enterprise development. Every Monday-Friday afternoon we taught business skills and knowledge to young people in Sawala. We selected 15 business ideas to pitch their ideas to Raleigh who could provide grants for up to 10 businesses. Our project was a huge success with the total 4 million Tsh being distributed between 20 entrepreneurs to start up 10 different businesses that Raleigh believed to be sustainable. We helped them set up their businesses and delivered sessions on how to find alternative sources of finance for those unable to receive the grant. The businesses included a nursery school, chicken business, female hair salon and milk business.

                <h3>Supportive Projects</h3>
                <p>In addition to delivering the entrepreneurship course, we had supportive projects during our time in Sawala, we held 3 action days to introduce ourselves and Raleigh to the community, to advertise the business course and to celebrate the entrepreneurs’ graduation. On Saturdays, we prepared lessons and taught at the local secondary school to teenagers aged between 13 – 16 years old. The lessons focused on business, the sustainable development goals and essay writing. To make our mark on Sawala, we spent our last few days painting a mural of the village.</p>
